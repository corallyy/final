abstract: Research papers which are convicing at the first glance might comes to an error end. Peer-reviews and critisms on research articles examin both the data and methodology of proposed statement of a research paper in order to justify the rightness of the usage. In the paper by AlShebli et al, the Association between Early Career Informal Mentorship in Academic Collaborations and Junior Author Performance has been studied. The statements are both interesting and noval, yet the article fails to prove the necessary support from both data and statistic methdology aspects. This report aims at a unbiased critism on this research topic by exploring the proposed data and the methods. The results shows the problematic process and the issues in its claims. Yet, the paper shows certain credits by offering the informative citation-index dataset.
keywords: Critique, Mentor-protégé pairs, causual inferences

## I. Introduction
### I.I Background
With the development of data observation and analysis techniques, many interesting researches have been conducted using casual inferences, or claimed that they have applied casual inferences. These researches often have statements supported by data and certain methodologies, therefore might sound valid and convincing for people without an academic background. However, data can be biased and misinterpreted. Therefore, most researches shall be peer-reviewed with thoroughly examination in order to demonstrate a promisingly unbiased evaluation and feedback of the research statements. 

The paper in Nature communications by AlShebli et al (AlShebli (2020)) is one of the controversial researches which brought out many concerns (Hullman (2020), Weeks(2020)). In this work, the authors have tried the explore the association between early career informal mentorship in academic collaborations and junior author performance. The mentorship is an interesting and important topic which contributes to the achievement and academic network of protégé's career,implicitly or explicitly(Singh (2002)).  The mentorship is an educational heritage process that the senior member pass on the organizational culture, best practices and the inner working of a profession. The role of mentorship has draw great attention and wildly recognized and studied in academic collaborations (Editorial (2019), Malmgre (2010)). 

The author claimed their novelties in the following aspects: firstly, they have claimed of a  study of the  mentorship in a broader sense, in this way they have allowed and used data in wider range with both formal and informal mentorship; Secondly, they claimed the avoidance of the sample selectivity as well as  recall and recency biases. This statement is based on their analysis of public accessible data (scientific impact) instead of self-reported information; Lastly they emphasized on the advantages in numerous data, which up to millions of mentor-protege pairs. The biggest finding, also the biggest controversial statement of their research is the claim of a female-female mentor relation will decrease the impact of both the mentor and protégé in their following academic years. This statement, although both interesting and potentially important if correct, might seems  convincing at beginning, however a deeper look would lead to many issues from both the data, analysis and their claim of novelties. Therefore this report gives an overall evaluation of the data as well as the speculations of their methodology.




### I.II Structure
The report is structured as follow: firstly the data used in the paper by AlShebli et al will be introduced and presented. The review of data is followed by the secotion of explaination of the authors' methodology. The results and the reasoning of their statement will be further demonstrated. The last and the most important part of the report is the discussion which gives a full examination of the data, itwill be further examined recording its statistic properties in order to analysis its validation in supporting the authors' claims. The post-hoc speculation which might driving the associations which being explored in the paper by AlShebli et al will be discussed accordingly.



## II. Data
The data used in the paper by AlShebli et al is abstracted from all the papers included in the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) dataset up to December 31st, 2019 (Wang (2019)). The MAG dataset contains all scientific publications with information of the publication date, author names and affiliations the the publication venue. It also contains the graph demonstrating the network of the papers with node prepresents the paper and edges represent a citation. Based on this graph, the authors abstracted the citations of a paper in a given year accordingly.  Using this data, the authors generate following featuresL the discipline of scientist, the impact of the scientist, the gender of the scientist and the ranking of the university. The gender is decided based on the learning of their first names, presented in the work by Wais et al. (Waise (2016)). In this study, about 3 million mentor-protégé paris are generated and analyzed.

As mentioned in the first novelties of the paper, the authors have explored a broader mentorship defined by the data by setting the threshold of a collabrations in the paper of as the academic age of 7. The junior scientist with academic age less than 7 is considerred as a protégé while the senior scientis with academic age more than 7 is considerred as a mentor. To evaluate on the achivement, the authors used two featuresL the big shot and the hub experience. The big shot is defined as the average impact of the mentors prior to mentorship, operationalized as “their average number of citations per annum up to the year of their first publication with the protégé.” . The hub experience is the e degree of the mentors in the network of scientific collaborations up to the year of their first publication with the protégé.  

## III. Method
The statistical methods applied in this paper are twofolds. Firstly they have used the surveys, in which 2000 scientists who have been defined as  protégé  have been asked regarding their relationship with their mentors. 167 of 2000 have completed the survey.

Secondly the mentor- protégé pairs have been analyzed using the coarsened exact matching (CEM) (Iacus (2012)). The authors have claimed that this methods are commonly used to infer causality, although not establish the existence of a causal effect. The CEM method select a group of protégés  who have received mentorship quality with a threshold level, and match it to another group of protégés  with lower level of mentor ship quality in order to demonstrate whether an increase in mentorship quality is associated with an increase in the impact of the protégés  post mentorship. Seperate CEM have been created where the two groups are different in term of number of mentors, year in which they published their first mentored paper, the scientific discipline, the gender and the rank of the affiliation list in their protégés time, the number of years active post mentorship, the average academic age of their mentors. Furthermore, the experiment is designed particularly that the two groups have similar big-shot experience in term of the hub experience and vice verse. The measurement are using the ith quintile of the distribution with $i \in {1,2,3,4}$.

## IV. Results
The survey outcome from the paper is presented in the following figure:
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Survey Outcome",out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig1.png")
```

The subfigure a shows the distribution of the responds in five different skills; subfigure b comtains the difference ways of summarizing the response; the percentage of the selection of answers accordingly are presented in subfigure c) and the subfigure d demonstrates summarzing of the response in c.

The mentor-protégé pairs CEM results are presented using the heat map as follow:
```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Mentor-protégé pairs heatmap", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig2.png")
```


In subfigure a), $F_i$ denotes the set of protégé that have exactly $i$ female mentors. Focusing on male protégés, $F_i$ vs. $F_0: i \in {1,2,3,4,5}$ refers to the change in the average post-mentorship impact of protégés in F i relative to the average post-mentorship impact of those in F 0 while controlling for the protégé’s big-shot experience, number of mentors, discipline, affiliation rank, and the year in which they published their first mentored paper. The asscoated p-value in t-test validate the significance. The subfigure b measures the same but for female protégé. The subfigure c shows the gain of a mentor categories in female mentors and male mentors, notice the values are negative and therefore implying the reduction on the impact.

## V. Discussion
The paper have a few issues, firstly, the data provided by the author of this paper has a few problem. First of all, the base of the data is using the learning on first name to predict the gender. The method presented in Wais et al. has an coded error rate equals to 43.3% and the unpredicted gender of 39.8% (Wais. (2016)).  Therefore the gender identification using the proposed method for further analysis is fundamentally questionable. Secondly, there is no gender information for mentors, therefore the mentor- protégé pair are not clearly defined.

The data also contains unresonable values. Since the data is enomour large, here only the first 50000 data are analysised. For the ProtegeFirstPubYear, time range is very large as presented as follow:

```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggExtra)
library(arsenal)
LinesRead <- 50000
inFile <- "E:/PT/TODO/Data_7yearcutoff.csv"
a <- read_csv(file = inFile, n_max = LinesRead)
a$MaleProtegeFirstPubYear <- a$ProtegeFirstPubYear
a$MaleProtegeFirstPubYear[a$Pr0tegeGender == "female"] <- NA

a$FemaleProtegeFirstPubYear <- a$ProtegeFirstPubYear
a$FemaleProtegeFirstPubYear[a$Pr0tegeGender == "male"] <- NA
a$ProtegeGender <- as.factor(a$Pr0tegeGender)
ggplot(data = a, mapping = aes(x = ProtegeFirstPubYear, y = Avg_c5)) + geom_point() + 
    facet_grid(~ProtegeGender) + ggtitle("ProtegeFirstPubYear vs. Avg_c5")



```

It can be seen from the plot that the time range for the year of the  protege's first publication is very large, leading difficulties to properly compare the impact factors as early before 1990s is not faired compared with year in 2013. Nextly we check the values of the number of years post the mentorship, the plot shows:
```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
p <- ggplot(data = a, mapping = aes(x = ProtegeFirstPubYear, y = NumYearsPostMentorship)) + 
    geom_point() + ggtitle("NumYearsPostMentorship vs. ProtegeFirstPubYear")
ggMarginal(p, type = "histogram")


```

The analysis shows, the data contains post mentor year up to near 120, which is unrealistic and implying a mis abstraction or mis calculation of the associated data. The same exist with the averaged mentor ac age:

```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = a, mapping = aes(x = ProtegeFirstPubYear, y = AvgMentorsAcAges)) + 
    geom_point() + facet_grid(~ProtegeGender) + ggtitle("ProtegeFirstPubYear vs. AvgMentorsAcAges by ProtegeGender")


```

It equally shows unreasonable values of more than 200.

The above data analysis imply either a misusage or extraction of the data, or a missing of necessary preprocessing of the data. Therefore the data itself is not well-defined or correctly used, and therefore fails to support the stated outcome.

Another major issues come from the methodology. Firstly, it is questionalbe to claim the citation index as the quality of a mentorship as it both failed to the rightness of the measurement and failed to cover the essence of mentorship. Simply using citation index would be fair, however to claim outcomes as quality is not convicing or even right.  Furthermore, the authors apply the speculation about the associations (Hullman et al.). As previous paper states, gender is known to have a robust effect on citation. Therefore one could expect female scientists to have lower big shot scores and lower mentorship outcomes on average based on the definiton, leading the analysis highly biased. Additionally, the authors claimed strong er association between mentorship outcome and big-shot experience than with hub expericne since changes to big shot experience have more impact given their quintile comparision, yet this is questionable as it only supported by the big-shot experience is significantly associated with an increase in the post-mentorship impact of proteges by up to 35% while that of hub experience never exceeds 13%. The interpretation of the data analysis is both unclear and lacking of sound inference statistics. The strong statement regarding the difference impact leaded by female-femal pairs failed to included the known gender effects in citations and therefore lacking of credits to show the statistic relations.

To conclude, the statements in the presented paper is weak, if not completely wrong as it both lacking of the right logic, convincing methodolog and the support data. Yet it has merits in other form - it provides interesting data which itself shows the citation-index patterns and its statistically properties. The problems lie in the leaking of the connections from the data and the further interpretation/causal inference using problematic methodology and biased data.


## Miscellaneous
When this report was written, the website of nature communication market the Editor's note as this paper is subject to criticsms. And when a final checked for the reference was made today, I found out the paper was retracted on 21 December 2020. It would not influence the critiques on this paper (other than another way to support that this paper is lacking of statistic evidence.). I feel it worthy mentioning the paper is retracted. And for the completeness of this report, I put this short message for the miscellaneous.
